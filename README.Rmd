## Vein Package

**V**ehicular **E**missions **IN**ventory **(VEIN)** model.



Read the DESCRIPTION file. You need several packages to run **vein**.

- [sp](https://github.com/edzer/sp/) 
- [units](https://github.com/edzer/units/) 
- [raster](http://cran.r-project.org/package=raster)
- [rgdal](https://github.com/cran/rgdal)
- [rgeos](https://github.com/cran/rgeos)

Also, if you want to properly run the demo, install these packages:

- ggplot2

```{r eval=F}
# 0.2.3.9000
library(devtools)
install_github("atmoschem/vein")
library(vein)
demo(VEIN)
```

or

```{r eval=F}
# 0.2.2-25
install.packages("vein")
library(vein)
```



I've created the following classes:

- Vehicles (1/h) 
- Speed  (km/h)
- EmissionFactors (g/km)
- EmissionFactorsList (g/km)
- Emissions  (g/h)
- EmissionsArray  (g/h)
- EmissionsList  (g/h)
- Evaporative  (g/d)

Each class has the methods print, plot and summary.

New information will also be added to the documentation of emission factors.

If you encounter any issues while using VEIN, please submit your issues to: https://github.com/ibarraespinosa/vein/issues/

If you have any suggestions just let me know to zergioibarra@gmail.com

Thanks and enjoy VEIN!

### **future steps**

- Migrate to [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/)
- Estimation of evaporative emissions with Copert Tier 3
- More speciations
- Solve issues
- Vignettes, blogs and a book (hopefully released in 2018)

#### Note:
The current versioning in VEIN is X.X.X-X. This is because version 0.2.2 is
in a paper on GMDD under open review: 

Ibarra-Espinosa, S., Ynoue, R., O'Sullivan, S., Pebesma, E.,
  Andrade, M. D. F., and Osses, M. (2017). VEIN v0.2.2: an R
  package for bottom-up Vehicular Emissions Inventories Geosci.
  Model Dev. Discus, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2017-193, in
  review, 2017.

However, once the paper is ready, the new versioning of VEIN will be:

- CRAN: X.X.X
- GITHUB: X.X.X-X (which will be more frequent from now)
- .9000 developemnt or experimental.

For example: Github: 0.2.2-30, next relase would be CRAN: 0.2.3.
If you use VEIN, please, cite it:

```{bash eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

    journal = {Geoscientific Model Development Discussions},
