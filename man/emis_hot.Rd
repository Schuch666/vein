\title{Estimation of emissions Hot Exhaust}
\usage{
emis_hot(veh, lkm, ef, speed = 34, agemax = ifelse(is.data.frame(veh),
  ncol(veh), ncol(veh[[1]])), profile, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{veh}{"Vehicles" data-frame or list of "Vehicles" data-frame. Each data-frame
as number of columns matching the age distribution of that ype of vehicle.
The number of rows is equal to the number of streets link}

\item{lkm}{Length of each link}

\item{ef}{List of functions of emission factors}

\item{speed}{Speed data-frame with number of columns as hours}

\item{agemax}{Age of oldest vehicles for that category}

\item{profile}{Dataframe or Matrix with nrows equal to 24 and ncol 7 day of
the week}

\item{verbose}{Logical; To show more information}
}
\value{
emission estimation  g/h
}
\description{
\code{\link{emis}} estimates vehicular emissions as the product of the
vehicles on a road, length of the road, emission factor avaliated at the
respective speed. \eqn{E = VEH*LENGTH*EF(speed)}
}
\note{
If the user apply a top-down approach, the resulting units will be
according its own data. For instance, if the vehicles are veh/day, the units
of the emissions implicitly will be g/day.
Hour and day will be deprecate because they can be infered from the profile
matrix.
